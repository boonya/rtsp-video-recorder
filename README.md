### Precondition

This library spawns `ffmpeg` as a child process, so it won't work with no `ffmpeg` package installed.
To do so just type:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
```

If you prefer different package manager or work on different linux distro use appropriate to your system command.

### Installation

Installation process of this lib as simple as it can be. Just run

```bash
npm i rtsp-video-recorder
```

And after that you can use is as on example below

### Example

```ts
import Recorder, { RecorderEvents } from "rtsp-video-recorder";

const recorder = new Recorder("rtsp://username:password@host/path", "/media/Recorder", {
  title: "Test Camera",
  segmentTime: 60
});

// Start recording
recorder.start();

recorder.on(RecorderEvents.STARTED, () => {
  /** Do what you need in case of recording started */
});

recorder.on(RecorderEvents.STOPPED, () => {
  /** Do what you need in case of recording stopped */
});

recorder.on(RecorderEvents.ERROR, () => {
  /** Do what you need in case of recording error */
});

recorder.on(RecorderEvents.DIRECTORY_CREATED, () => {
